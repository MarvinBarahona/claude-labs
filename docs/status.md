# Status

The single source of truth for what's next and what's already done. Every work item is one row below, in build order, with its current status, its slug, and a link to whichever doc currently describes it — its plan file while it's `Draft`/`Planned`/`In progress`, its permanent doc once `Done`. Each work item's own doc describes what it *is*; this table only tracks where it *stands*.

## Status values

⚪ `Not started` (no plan file yet) → 📝 `Draft` (plan file exists: description, open questions, likely dependencies) → 📋 `Planned` (self-contained: principles inlined, test scenarios and a to-do list in place) → 🔵 `In progress` (being implemented and tested) → ✅ `Done` (graduated; the Doc column above points at the permanent doc instead of the retired plan file).

The leading emoji is the color cue for each status (plain Markdown can't set text color on GitHub) — always ⚪/📝/📋/🔵/✅ in that order, both in this table's Status column and in a plan file's own `**Status:**` line. Reused, don't invent new ones.

| Transition | Happens when |
|---|---|
| — → `Draft` | a plan file is drafted for the item |
| `Draft` → `Planned` | the draft is fleshed out into a self-contained plan |
| `Planned` → `In progress` | implementation starts (not on completion) |
| `In progress` → `Done` | the build is manually approved |
| `Draft`/`Planned` → *(row removed)* | the item is abandoned before being built |

This table is a summary pointer — whatever process currently carries out each step is the authoritative definition of what its transition requires; update this row only if that changes.
